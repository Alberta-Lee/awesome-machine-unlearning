Reasons for Machine\n","Unlearning</h2>\n","<p>There are many reasons for why a users may want to delete their data\n","from a system. We have categorized these into four major groups:\n","security, privacy, usability, and fidelity. Each reason is discussed in\n","more detail next.</p>\n","<p><strong>Security.</strong> Recently, deep learning models have been\n","shown to be vulnerable to external attacks, especially adversarial\n","attacks&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-ren2020adversarial\">(K. Ren\n","et al. 2020)</a>. In an adversarial attack, the attacker generates\n","adversarial data that are very similar to the original data to the\n","extent that a human cannot distinguish between the real and fake data.\n","This adversarial data is designed to force the deep learning models into\n","outputting wrong predictions, which frequently results in serious\n","problems. For example, in healthcare, a wrong prediction could lead to a\n","wrong diagnosis, a non-suitable treatment, even a death. Hence,\n","detecting and removing adversarial data is essential for ensuring the\n","model&#x2019;s security and, once an attack is detected, the model needs to be\n","able delete the adversarial data through a machine unlearning\n","mechanism&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards marchant2022hard\">(Y.

In this\n","particular regulation, users must be given the right to have their data\n","and related information deleted to protect their privacy. In part, this\n","legislation has sprung up as a result of privacy leaks. For example,\n","cloud systems can leak user data due to multiple copies of data hold by\n","different parties, backup policies, and replication strategies&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-singh2017data\">(A. Singh and Anand\n","2017)</a>.

Wang et al. 2009)</a>. It is therefore not surprising that\n","users would want to remove their data to avoid the risks of a data\n","leak&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards\">(Y. Cao and Yang\n","2015)</a>.</p>\n","<p><strong>Usability.</strong> People have difference preferences in\n","online applications and/or services, especially recommender systems. An\n","application will produce inconvenient recommendations if it cannot\n","completely delete the incorrect data (e.&#x2006;g.,&#xA0;noise, malicious data,\n","out-of-distribution data) related to a user.

Cao and Yang 2015)</a>. Such\n","undesired usability by not forgetting data will not only produce wrong\n","predictions, but also result in less users.</p>\n","<p><strong>Fidelity.</strong> Unlearning requests might come from biased\n","machine learning models. Despite recent advances, machine learning\n","models are still sensitive to bias that means their output can unfairly\n","discriminate against a group of people&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-mehrabi2021survey\">(Mehrabi et al. 2021)</a>.

Challenges in Machine\n","Unlearning</h2>\n","<p>Before we can truly achieve machine unlearning, several challenges to\n","removing specific parts of the training data need to be overcome. The\n","challenges are summarized as follows.</p>\n","<p><strong>Stochasticity of training.</strong> We do not know the impact\n","of each data point seen during training on the machine learning model\n","due to the stochastic nature of the training procedure&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al.\n","2021)</a>.

This stochasticity raises difficulties for machine\n","unlearning as the specific data sample to be removed would need to be\n","removed from all batches.</p>\n","<p><strong>Incrementality of training.</strong> A model&#x2019;s training\n","procedure is an incremental process&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al. 2021)</a>. In\n","other words, the model update on a given data sample will affect the\n","model performance on data samples fed into the model after this data.

In general, a model is trained on\n","some data and is then used for inference. Upon a removal request, the\n","data-to-be-forgotten is unlearned from the model. The unlearned model is\n","then verified against privacy criteria, and, if these criteria are not\n","met, the model is retrained, i.e., if the model still leaks some\n","information about the forgotten data. There are two main components to\n","this process: the <em>learning component</em> (left) and the\n","<em>unlearning component</em> (right). The learning component involves\n","the current data, a learning algorithm, and the current model. In the\n","beginning, the initial model is trained from the whole dataset using the\n","learning algorithm. The unlearning component involves an unlearning\n","algorithm, the unlearned model, optimization requirements, evaluation\n","metrics, and a verification mechanism. Upon a data removal request, the\n","current model will be processed by an unlearning algorithm to forget the\n","corresponding information of that data inside the model. The unlearning\n","algorithm might take several requirements into account such as\n","completeness, timeliness, and privacy guarantees.

However, to\n","provide a privacy certificate for the unlearned model, a verification\n","(or audit) is needed to prove that the model actually forgot the\n","requested data and that there are no information leaks.

Either way, the unlearning component\n","will be called repeatedly upon a new removal request.</p>\n","\n","<h2 id=\"unlearning-requests\">2.2. Unlearning Requests</h2>\n","<p><strong>Item Removal.</strong> Requests to remove certain\n","items/samples from the training data are the most common requests in\n","machine unlearning&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al. 2021)</a>. The\n","techniques used to unlearn these data are described in detail in <a\n","href=\"#sec:algorithms\" data-reference-type=\"autoref\"\n","data-reference=\"sec:algorithms\">[sec:algorithms]</a>.</p>\n","<p><strong>Feature Removal.</strong> In many scenarios, privacy leaks\n","might not only originate from a single data item but also in a group of\n","data with the similar features or labels&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-warnecke2021machine\">(Warnecke et al. 2021)</a>. For\n","example, a poisoned spam filter might misclassify malicious addresses\n","that are present in thousands of emails. Thus, unlearning suspicious\n","emails might not enough. Similarly, in an application screening system,\n","inappropriate features, such as the gender or race of applicants, might\n","need to be unlearned for thousands of affected applications.</p>\n","<p>In such cases, naively unlearning the affected data items\n","sequentially is imprudent as repeated retraining is computationally\n","expensive. Moreover, unlearning too many data items can inherently\n","reduce the performance of the model, regardless of the unlearning\n","mechanism used. Thus, there is a need for unlearning data at the feature\n","or label level with an arbitrary number of data items.</p>\n","<p>Warnecke et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-warnecke2021machine\">(Warnecke et al. 2021)</a> proposed\n","a technique for unlearning a group of training data based on influence\n","functions. More precisely, the effect of training data on model\n","parameter updates is estimated and formularized in closed-form. As a\n","result of this formulation, influences of the learning sets act as a\n","compact update instead of solving an optimisation problem iteratively\n","(e.g., loss minimization). First-order and second-order derivatives are\n","the keys to computing this update effectively&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-warnecke2021machine\">(Warnecke et al. 2021)</a>.</p>\n","<p>Guo et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-guo2022efficient\">(T.\n","Guo et al. 2022)</a> proposed another technique to unlearn a feature\n","in the data based on disentangled representation. The core idea is to\n","learn the correlation between features from the latent space as well as\n","the effects of each feature on the output space. Using this information,\n","certain features can be progressively detached from the learnt model\n","upon request, while the remaining features are still preserved to\n","maintain good accuracy. However, this method is mostly applicable to\n","deep neural networks in the image domain, in which the deeper\n","convolutional layers become smaller and can therefore identify abstract\n","features that match real-world data attributes.</p>\n","<p><strong>Class Removal.</strong> There are many scenarios where the\n","forgetting data belongs to single or multiple classes from a trained\n","model. For example, in face recognition applications, each class is a\n","person&#x2019;s face so there could potentially be thousands or millions of\n","classes. However, when a user opts out of the system, their face\n","information must be removed without using a sample of their face.</p>\n","<p>Similar to feature removal, class removal is more challenging than\n","item removal because retraining solutions can incur many unlearning\n","passes. Even though each pass might only come at a small computational\n","cost due to data partitioning, the expense mounts up. However,\n","partitioning data by class itself does not help the model&#x2019;s training in\n","the first place, as learning the differences between classes is the core\n","of many learning algorithms&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-tanha2020boosting\">(Tanha et al. 2020)</a>. Although some\n","of the above techniques for feature removal can be applied to class\n","removal&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-warnecke2021machine\">(Warnecke et al. 2021)</a>, it is\n","not always the case as class information might be implicit in many\n","scenarios.</p>\n","<p>Tarun et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-tarun2021fast\">(Tarun\n","et al. 2021)</a> proposed an unlearning method for class removal\n","based on data augmentation. The basic concept is to introduce noise into\n","the model such that the classification error is maximized for the target\n","class(es). The model is updated by training on this noise without the\n","need to access any samples of the target class(es). Since such impair\n","step may disturb the model weights and degrade the classification\n","performance for the remaining classes, a repair step is needed to train\n","the model for one or a few more epochs on the remaining data. Their\n","experiments show that the method can be efficient for large-scale\n","multi-class problems (100 classes). Further, the method worked\n","especially well with face recognition tasks because the deep neural\n","networks were originally trained on triplet loss and negative samples so\n","the difference between the classes was quite significant&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-masi2018deep\">(Masi et al.\n","2018)</a>.</p>\n","<p>Baumhauer et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-baumhauer2020machine\">(Baumhauer, Sch&#xF6;ttle, and Zeppelzauer\n","2020)</a> proposed an unlearning method for class removal based on a\n","linear filtration operator that proportionally shifts the classification\n","of the samples of the class to be forgotten to other classes. However,\n","the approach is only applicable to class removal due to the\n","characteristics of this operator.</p>\n","<p><strong>Task Removal.</strong> Today, machine learning models are not\n","only trained for a single task but also for multiple tasks. This\n","paradigm, aka continual learning or lifelong learning&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-parisi2019continual\">(Parisi et al.\n","2019)</a>, is motivated by the human brain, in which learning\n","multiple tasks can benefit each other due to their correlations. This\n","technique is also used overcome data sparsity or cold-start problems\n","where there is not enough data to train a single task effectively.</p>\n","<p>However, in these settings too, there can be a need to remove private\n","data related to a specific task. For example, consider a robot that is\n","trained to assist a patient at home during their medical treatment. This\n","robot may be asked to forget this assistance behaviour after the patient\n","has recovered&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2022continual\">(B.\n","Liu, Liu, et al. 2022)</a>. To this end, temporarily learning a task\n","and forgetting it in the future has become a need for lifelong learning\n","models.</p>\n","<p>In general, unlearning a task is uniquely challenging as continual\n","learning might depend on the order of the learned tasks. Therefore,\n","removing a task might create a catastrophic unlearning effect, where the\n","overall performance of multiple tasks is degraded in a\n","domino-effect&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2022continual\">(B.\n","Liu, Liu, et al. 2022)</a>. Mitigating this problem requires the\n","model to be aware of that the task may potentially be removed in future.\n","Liu et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2022continual\">(B. Liu,\n","Liu, et al. 2022)</a> explains that this requires users to explicitly\n","define which tasks will be learned permanently and which tasks will be\n","learned only temporarily.</p>\n","<p><strong>Stream Removal.</strong> Handling data streams where a huge\n","amount of data arrives online requires some mechanisms to retain or\n","ignore certain data while maintaining limited storage&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-nguyen2017retaining\">(Tam et al.\n","2017)</a>.

This is motivated by the fact that many users can be involved\n","in a machine learning system and decide to delete their data\n","sequentially. Such is also the case when the training data has been\n","poisoned in an adversarial attack and the data needs to be deleted\n","gradually to recover the model&#x2019;s performance. These streaming requests\n","can be either non-adaptive or adaptive. A non-adaptive request means\n","that the removal sequence does not depend on the intermediate results of\n","each unlearning request, whereas and adaptive request means that the\n","data to be removed depends on the current unlearned model.

Unlearning Verification</h2>\n","<p>The goal of unlearning verification methods is to certify that one\n","cannot easily distinguish between the unlearned models and their\n","retrained counterparts&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-thudi2021necessity\">(Thudi, Jia, et al. 2022)</a>. While\n","the evaluation metrics (<a href=\"#sec:metrics\"\n","data-reference-type=\"autoref\"\n","data-reference=\"sec:metrics\">[sec:metrics]</a>) are theoretical criteria\n","for machine unlearning, unlearning verification can act as a certificate\n","for an unlearned model. They also include best practices for validating\n","the unlearned models efficiently.</p>\n","<p>It is noteworthy that while unlearning metrics (in <a\n","href=\"#sec:formulation\" data-reference-type=\"autoref\"\n","data-reference=\"sec:formulation\">[sec:formulation]</a>) and verification\n","metrics share some overlaps, the big difference is that the former can\n","be used for optimization or to provide a bounded guarantee, while the\n","latter is used for evaluation only.</p>\n","<p><strong>Feature Injection Test.</strong> The goal of this test is to\n","verify whether the unlearned model has adjusted the weights\n","corresponding to the removed data samples based on data\n","features/attributes&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-izzo2021approximate\">(Izzo et al. 2021)</a>. The idea is\n","that if the set of data to be forgotten has a very distinct feature\n","distinguishing it from the remaining set, it gives a strong signal for\n","the model weights. However, this feature needs to be correlated with the\n","labels of the set to be forgotten, otherwise the model might not learn\n","anything from this feature.</p>\n","<p>More precisely, an extra feature is added for each data item such\n","that it is equal to zero for the remaining set and is perfectly\n","correlated with the labels of the set to forget. Izzo et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-izzo2021approximate\">(Izzo et al.\n","2021)</a> applied this idea with linear classifiers, where the weight\n","associated with this extra feature is expected to be significantly\n","different from zero after training. After the model is unlearned, this\n","weight is expected to become zero. As a result, the difference of this\n","weight can be plotted before and after unlearning as a measure of\n","effectiveness of the unlearning process.</p>\n","<p>One limitation of this verification method is that the current\n","solution is only applicable for linear and logistic models&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-izzo2021approximate\">(Izzo et al.\n","2021)</a>. This is because these models have explicit weights\n","associated with the injected feature, whereas, for other models such as\n","deep learning, injecting such a feature as a strong signal is\n","non-trivial, even though the set to be forgotten is small. Another\n","limitation to these types of methods is that an injected version of the\n","data needs to be created so that the model can be learned (either from\n","scratch or incrementally depending on the type of the model).</p>\n","<p><strong>Forgetting Measuring.</strong> Even after the data to be\n","forgotten has been unlearned from the model, it is still possible for\n","the model to carry detectable traces of those samples&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-jagielski2022measuring\">(Jagielski et al.\n","2022)</a>. Jagielski et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-jagielski2022measuring\">(Jagielski et al. 2022)</a>\n","proposed a formal way to measure the forgetfulness of a model via\n","privacy attacks. More precisely, a model is said to <span\n","class=\"math inline\"><em>&#x3B1;</em></span>-forget a training sample if a\n","privacy attack (e.g., a membership inference) on that sample achieves no\n","greater than success rate <span class=\"math inline\"><em>&#x3B1;</em></span>.\n","This definition is more flexible than differential privacy because a\n","training algorithm is differentially private only if it immediately\n","forgets every sample it learns.

However, one has to rely on a customized learning\n","algorithm that optimizes a perturbed version of the regularized\n","empirical risk, where the added noise is drawn from a standard normal\n","distribution. This normalized noise allows conventional convex\n","optimization techniques to solve the learning problem with perturbation.\n","As a result, the unlearning request can be done by computing the model\n","perturbation towards the regularized empirical risk on the remaining\n","data. The final trick is that this perturbation can be approximated by\n","the influence function&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-koh2017understanding\">(Koh et al. 2017)</a>, which is\n","computed by inverting the Hessian on training data and the gradient of\n","the data to be forgotten&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-marchant2022hard\">(Marchant, Rubinstein, and Alfeld\n","2022)</a>. However, the error of model parameters in such a\n","computation can be so large that the added noise cannot mask it.\n","Therefore, if the provided theoretical upper bound exceeds a certain\n","threshold, the unlearning algorithm resorts to retraining from\n","scratch&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-marchant2022hard\">(Marchant,\n","Rubinstein, and Alfeld 2022)</a>.</p>\n","<p>Following this idea, Neel et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-neel2021descent\">(Neel, Roth, and Sharifi-Malvajerdi\n","2021)</a> provided further extensions, namely regularized perturbed\n","gradient descent and distributed perturbed gradient descent, to support\n","weak convex losses and provide theoretical guarantees on\n","indistinguishability, accuracy, and unlearning times.</p>\n","<p>Ullah et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-ullah2021machine\">(Ullah et al. 2021)</a> continued\n","studying machine unlearning in the context of SGD and streaming removal\n","requests.

In this form, a data sample can be forgotten efficiently\n","by recomputing the statistics over the remaining data&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al.\n","2021)</a>. More precisely, statistical query learning assumes that\n","most of the learning algorithms can be represented as a sum of some\n","efficiently computable transformations, called statistical queries&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-kearns1998efficient\">(Kearns 1998)</a>.\n","These statistical queries are basically requests to an oracle (e.g., a\n","ground truth) to estimate a statistical function over all training data.\n","Cao et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards\">(Y. Cao\n","and Yang 2015)</a> showed that this formulation can generalize many\n","algorithms for machine learning, such as the Chi-square test, naive\n","Bayes, and linear regression. For example, in naive Bayes, these\n","statistical queries are indicator functions that return 1 when the\n","output is a target label and zero otherwise&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards\">(Y. Cao and Yang 2015)</a>. In the\n","unlearning process, these queries are simply recomputed over the\n","remaining data. The approach is efficient as these statistical functions\n","are computationally efficient in the first place. Moreover, statistical\n","query learning also supports adaptive statistical queries, which are\n","computed based on the prior state of the learning models, including\n","k-means, SVM, and gradient descent. Although this time, the unlearning\n","update makes the model not convergent any more, only a few learning\n","iterations (adaptive statistical queries) are needed since the model\n","starts from an almost-converged state. Moreover, if the old results of\n","the summations are cached, say, via dynamic programming, then the\n","speedup might be even higher.</p>\n","<p>The limitation of this approach is that it does not scale with\n","complex models such as deep neural networks. Indeed, in complex models,\n","the number of statistical queries could become exponentially large&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al.\n","2021)</a>, making both the unlearning and relearning steps less\n","efficient.</p>\n","<p>In general, statistical query learning supports item removal and can\n","be partially applied to stream removal&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-gupta2021adaptive\">(Gupta et al. 2021)</a> as well,\n","although the streaming updates to the summations could be unbounded. It\n","supports exact unlearning, but only partially when the statistical\n","queries are non-adaptive.

In particular,\n","retraining uses the whole training set to execute the learning\n","algorithm, whereas unlearning executes the learning algorithm on a\n","limited amount of summations; hence, the speed of unlearning is quicker\n","due to the reduced size of the training data.</p>\n","<p><strong>Relearn time.</strong> Relearning time is an excellent proxy\n","for measuring the amount of unlearned data information left in the\n","model. If a model recovers its performance on unlearned data with just a\n","few steps of retraining, it is extremely probable that the model has\n","retained some knowledge of the unlearned data.</p>\n","<p><strong>The layer-wise distance.</strong> The layer-wise distance\n","between the original and unlearned models helps when trying to\n","understand the impact of the unlearning on each layer. The weight\n","difference should be comparable to a retrained model given that a\n","shorter distance indicates ineffective unlearning. Likewise, a much\n","longer distance may point to a Streisand effect and possible information\n","leaks.</p>\n","<p><strong>Activation Distance.</strong> The activation distance is the\n","separation between the final activation of the scrubbed weights and the\n","retrained model. A shorter activation distance indicates superior\n","unlearning.</p>\n","<p><strong>JS-Divergence.</strong> When paired with the activation\n","distance, the JS-Divergence between the predictions of the unlearned and\n","retrained model provides a more full picture of unlearning. Less\n","divergence results in better unlearning. The formula of JS-Divergence is\n","<span\n","class=\"math inline\">&#x1D4A5;&#x1D4AE;(<em>M</em>(<em>x</em>),<em>T</em><sub><em>d</em></sub>(<em>x</em>))&#x2004;=&#x2004;0.5&#x2005;*&#x2005;&#x1D4A6;&#x2112;(<em>M</em>(<em>x</em>)||<em>m</em>)&#x2005;+&#x2005;0.5&#x2005;*&#x2005;&#x1D4A6;&#x2112;(<em>T</em><sub><em>d</em></sub>(<em>x</em>)||<em>m</em>)</span>,\n","where <span class=\"math inline\"><em>M</em></span> is unlearned model,\n","<span class=\"math inline\"><em>T</em><sub><em>d</em></sub></span> is a\n","competent teacher, and <span class=\"math inline\">&#x1D4A6;&#x2112;</span> is The\n","Kullback-Leibler divergence <a href=\"#ref-KLFormula\">(Kullback et al. 1951)</a>, <span\n","class=\"math inline\">$m= \\frac{M(x)+T_d(x)}{2}$</span>.</p>\n","<p><strong>Membership Inference.</strong> The membership inference\n","metric leverages a membership inference attack to determine whether or\n","not any information about the forgotten samples remains in the\n","model&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-chen2021machine\">(M.

The\n","unpredictability of the model&#x2019;s predictions is measured by comparing\n","them to an unskilled instructor. ZRF compares the set to be forgotten&#x2019;s\n","output distribution to the output of a randomly initialised model, which\n","in most situations is our lousy instructor. The ZRF score ranges between\n","0 and 1; it will be near to 1 if the model&#x2019;s behaviour with the\n","forgotten samples is entirely random, and close to 0 if it exhibits a\n","certain pattern.

A score closer to 0 also\n","suggests that the unlearned model will rapidly relearn to generate\n","correct predictions. This may be due to the fact that the last layers\n","contain limited reversible modifications, which degrades the performance\n","of the model on the forgotten classes. If an AIN score is much greater\n","than 1, it may suggest that the approach causes parameter changes that\n","are so severe that the unlearning itself may be detected (Streisand\n","effect).
