However, the abundance of data poses risks to user privacy and can erode the trust between humans and AI. To address these concerns, recent regulations, commonly known as \"the right to be forgotten\", mandate the removal of private user information from computer systems and machine learning models. While erasing data from back-end databases is relatively straightforward, it is insufficient in the context of AI since machine learning models often retain memories of the old data. Additionally, recent adversarial attacks on trained models have demonstrated the ability to identify whether instances or attributes belonged to the training data. This necessitates a new approach called *machine unlearning* to make machine learning models forget specific data. However, existing works on machine unlearning have yet to fully solve the problem due to the lack of standardized frameworks and resources.\n","\n","This survey aims to provide a comprehensive examination of machine unlearning, including its concepts, scenarios, methods, and applications. By assembling a collection of cutting-edge studies, our intention is to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking an introduction to machine unlearning. We cover various aspects of the topic, including formulation, design criteria, removal requests, algorithms, and practical applications. Furthermore, we aim to identify key findings, current trends, and unexplored research areas that could greatly benefit from the application of machine unlearning. Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the advancement of privacy technologies and provide insights for machine learning researchers and innovators.\n","\n","For the convenience of the readers, all the resources related to this survey can be accessed publicly on our GitHub repository at <https://github.com/tamlhp/awesome-machine-unlearning>.

This comprehensive survey provides an overview of the fundamental principles, methodologies, and real-world applications of machine unlearning. By bridging the gap in existing research and highlighting untapped potential, we hope to inspire further exploration and innovation in the field.

Introduction</h1>\n","<p>Computer systems in today's digital landscape store vast amounts of personal data, facilitated by significant advancements in data storage and transfer technologies. The proliferation of data production, recording, and processing has skyrocketed, exemplified by the staggering number of daily YouTube video views, which exceeds four billion&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-sari2020learning\">(Sari et al.\n","2020)</a>. These online personal data encompass digital footprints left by internet users, reflecting their behaviors, interactions, and communication patterns in the real world&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-nguyen2019debunking\">(Nguyen et al, 2019)</a>. Additionally, personal data originates from various sources, including user-generated digital content such as product reviews, blog posts (e.g., Medium), social media status updates (e.g., Instagram), and knowledge sharing platforms (e.g., Wikipedia)&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-nguyen2021judo\">(Nguyen et al. 2021)</a>. Furthermore, the scope of personal data has expanded to encompass information collected from wearable devices&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-ren2022prototype\">(Ren et al., 2022)</a>. While this abundance of data has propelled advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), it also poses threats to user privacy and has contributed to numerous data breaches<a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards\">(Cao and Yang, 2015)</a>. Consequently, some users may desire complete removal of their data from systems, particularly in sensitive domains like finance or healthcare&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-ren2022prototype\">(Ren et al., 2022)</a>. Recent regulations now mandate organizations to provide users with the \"right to be forgotten,\" granting them the ability to request the deletion of all or part of their data from a system&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-dang2021right\">(Dang et al., 2021)</a>.\n","</p>\n","\n","<p>\n","Although complying with regulations by removing data from back-end databases is a step in the right direction, it falls short in the AI context due to the persistent &#x2018;memory&#x2019; of old data by machine learning models. During the training phase of these models, millions, if not billions, of users data are processed. However, unlike humans who grasp general patterns, machine learning models tend to function more like lossy data compression mechanisms&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-schelter2020amnesia\">(Schelter, 2020)</a>, and some become overly specialized to their training data. Notably, the success of deep learning models has recently been attributed to the compression of training data&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-tishby2000information tishby2015deep\">(Tishby et al. 2000; Tishby and Zaslavsky 2015)</a>. The existence of this memorization behavior is further substantiated by studies on adversarial attacks, which have demonstrated the extraction of private information from trained models within specific target data&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-ren2020generating chang2022example ren2020enhancing\">(Z.\n","Ren, Baird, et al. 2020; Chang et al. 2022; Z.

Reasons for Machine\n","Unlearning</h2>\n","<p>There are various reasons why users might want to delete their data from a system. We can categorize these reasons into four main groups: security, privacy, usability, and fidelity. Each of these reasons is discussed in more detail below.</p>\n","\n","<p><strong>Security.</strong> Deep learning models have recently revealed vulnerabilities to external attacks, particularly adversarial attacks <a href=\"#ref-ren2020adversarial\">(K. Ren et al., 2020)</a>. In an adversarial attack, the attacker generates adversarial data that closely resembles the original data to the point where human perception cannot distinguish between the real and fake data. This adversarial data is purposely crafted to manipulate deep learning models, causing them to generate inaccurate predictions, often leading to significant consequences. For instance, in healthcare, an erroneous prediction could result in misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, or even loss of life. Therefore, it is imperative to detect and remove adversarial data to ensure the security of the model. Once an attack is identified, the model must be capable of deleting the adversarial data through a machine unlearning mechanism <a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards marchant2022hard\">(Y. Cao and Yang 2015; Marchant, Rubinstein, and Alfeld 2022)</a>.</p>\n","\n","<p><strong>Privacy.</strong> Numerous privacy-preserving regulations have recently been implemented, encompassing the right to be forgotten <a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine dang2021right\">(Bourtoule et al., 2021; Dang, 2021)</a>, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union <a href=\"#ref-magdziarczyk2019right\">(Mantelero, 2013)</a> and the California Consumer Privacy Act <a href=\"#ref-pardau2018california\">(Pardau, 2018)</a>. These regulations grant users the right to request the deletion of their data and related information in order to safeguard their privacy. Such legislation has emerged in response to instances of privacy breaches. For example, cloud systems can inadvertently expose user data due to multiple copies stored by various entities, backup policies, and replication strategies <a href=\"#ref-singh2017data\">(A. Singh and Anand, 2017)</a>. In another scenario, machine learning techniques used in genetic data processing have been found to unintentionally disclose patients' genetic markers <a href=\"#ref-fredrikson2014privacy wang2009learning\">(Fredrikson et al., 2014; R. Wang et al., 2009)</a>. Hence, it is unsurprising that users seek to remove their data to mitigate the risks of data leaks <a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards\">(Y. Cao and Yang, 2015)</a>.</p>\n","\n","<p><strong>Usability.</strong> People have diverse preferences when it comes to online applications and services, particularly recommender systems. An application's recommendations can be inconvenient if it fails to completely remove incorrect data (e.g., noise, malicious data, out-of-distribution data) associated with a user. For instance, if someone unintentionally searches for an illegal product on their laptop and continues to receive recommendations for that product on their phone, even after clearing their web browser history, it leads to undesired usability <a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards\">(Y. Cao and Yang, 2015)</a>. Such persistent data retention not only results in inaccurate predictions but also reduces user satisfaction and engagement.</p>\n","\n","<p><strong>Fidelity.</strong> Biased machine learning models can prompt requests for unlearning. Despite recent advancements, machine learning models are still susceptible to bias, resulting in outputs that unfairly discriminate against specific groups of people <a href=\"#ref-mehrabi2021survey\">(Mehrabi et al., 2021)</a>. For instance, COMPAS, a software employed by courts to determine parole cases, demonstrates a higher tendency to assign elevated risk scores to African-American offenders compared to Caucasians, even when ethnicity information is not included as input <a href=\"#ref-zou2018ai\">(Zou and Schiebinger, 2018)</a>. Similar instances of bias have been observed in beauty contests judged by AI, which exhibited prejudice against participants with darker skin tones, as well as facial recognition AI systems that inaccurately recognized Asian facial features <a href=\"#ref-feuerriegel2020fair\">(Feuerriegel, Dolata, and Schwabe, 2020)</a>.</p>\n","\n","<p>The origin of these biases can often be traced back to the data itself. For instance, AI systems trained on public datasets that predominantly feature individuals of white ethnicity, such as ImageNet, are more prone to making errors when processing images of individuals with black ethnicity. Similarly, in an application screening system, the machine learning model might unintentionally acquire inappropriate features, such as gender or race information, during the learning process <a href=\"#ref-dinsdale2021deep dinsdale2020unlearning\">(Dinsdale, Jenkinson, and Namburete, 2021; Dinsdale, Jenkinson, et al., 2020)</a>. Consequently, there is a necessity to unlearn such data, which involves discarding the associated features and affected data items.</p>\n","\n","<h2 id=\"challenges-in-machine-unlearning\">1.2. Challenges in Machine\n","Unlearning</h2>\n","\n","<p>Before we can fully achieve machine unlearning, there are several challenges that must be addressed in order to selectively remove specific portions of the training data. These challenges can be summarized as follows:</p>\n","<p><strong>Stochasticity of training.</strong> Due to the stochastic nature of the training process, we lack precise knowledge of the impact of each data point encountered during training on the machine learning model <a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al., 2021)</a>. For example, neural networks are typically trained on random mini-batches consisting of a fixed number of data samples, and the order of these training batches is also randomized <a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al., 2021)</a>. This stochasticity poses challenges for machine unlearning since the specific data sample to be removed would need to be eliminated from all batches consistently.</p>\n","<p><strong>Incrementality of training.</strong> The training process of a model is incremental, meaning that updates made to the model based on a particular data sample will impact the model's performance on subsequent data samples <a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al., 2021)</a>. Additionally, a model's performance on a given data sample is influenced by prior data samples. Finding a way to nullify the effects of a targeted training sample on the model's future performance poses a challenge for machine unlearning.</p>\n","<p><strong>Catastrophic unlearning.</strong> Typically, an unlearned model performs worse than a model retrained on the remaining data <a href=\"#ref-nguyen2020variational nguyen2022markov\">(Q. P. Nguyen, Low, and Jaillet, 2020; Q. P. Nguyen et al., 2022)</a>. However, the degradation can become exponential when more data is unlearned, leading to what is commonly known as catastrophic unlearning <a href=\"#ref-nguyen2020variational\">(Q. P. Nguyen, Low, and Jaillet, 2020)</a>. While various studies <a href=\"#ref-du2019lifelong golatkar2020eternal\">(Du, Chen, et al., 2019; Golatkar, Achille, and Soatto, 2020a)</a> have explored techniques to mitigate catastrophic unlearning through the design of specialized loss functions, finding natural ways to prevent catastrophic unlearning remains an open question.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ab52bfb6","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008201,"end_time":"2023-07-12T05:32:31.618294","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-12T05:32:31.610093","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<h2 id=\"contributions-of-this-survey\">1.3.

In general, a model is trained on\n","some data and is then used for inference. Upon a removal request, the\n","data-to-be-forgotten is unlearned from the model. The unlearned model is\n","then verified against privacy criteria, and, if these criteria are not\n","met, the model is retrained, i.e., if the model still leaks some\n","information about the forgotten data. There are two main components to\n","this process: the <em>learning component</em> (left) and the\n","<em>unlearning component</em> (right). The learning component involves\n","the current data, a learning algorithm, and the current model.

Unlearning Requests</h2>\n","<p><strong>Item Removal.</strong> Requests to remove certain\n","items/samples from the training data are the most common requests in\n","machine unlearning&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al. 2021)</a>. The\n","techniques used to unlearn these data are described in detail in <a\n","href=\"#sec:algorithms\" data-reference-type=\"autoref\"\n","data-reference=\"sec:algorithms\">[sec:algorithms]</a>.</p>\n","<p><strong>Feature Removal.</strong> In many scenarios, privacy leaks\n","might not only originate from a single data item but also in a group of\n","data with the similar features or labels&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-warnecke2021machine\">(Warnecke et al. 2021)</a>. For\n","example, a poisoned spam filter might misclassify malicious addresses\n","that are present in thousands of emails. Thus, unlearning suspicious\n","emails might not enough.

Moreover, unlearning too many data items can inherently\n","reduce the performance of the model, regardless of the unlearning\n","mechanism used. Thus, there is a need for unlearning data at the feature\n","or label level with an arbitrary number of data items.</p>\n","<p>Warnecke et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-warnecke2021machine\">(Warnecke et al. 2021)</a> proposed\n","a technique for unlearning a group of training data based on influence\n","functions. More precisely, the effect of training data on model\n","parameter updates is estimated and formularized in closed-form. As a\n","result of this formulation, influences of the learning sets act as a\n","compact update instead of solving an optimisation problem iteratively\n","(e.g., loss minimization). First-order and second-order derivatives are\n","the keys to computing this update effectively&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-warnecke2021machine\">(Warnecke et al. 2021)</a>.</p>\n","<p>Guo et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-guo2022efficient\">(T.\n","Guo et al. 2022)</a> proposed another technique to unlearn a feature\n","in the data based on disentangled representation. The core idea is to\n","learn the correlation between features from the latent space as well as\n","the effects of each feature on the output space. Using this information,\n","certain features can be progressively detached from the learnt model\n","upon request, while the remaining features are still preserved to\n","maintain good accuracy. However, this method is mostly applicable to\n","deep neural networks in the image domain, in which the deeper\n","convolutional layers become smaller and can therefore identify abstract\n","features that match real-world data attributes.</p>\n","<p><strong>Class Removal.</strong> There are many scenarios where the\n","forgetting data belongs to single or multiple classes from a trained\n","model. For example, in face recognition applications, each class is a\n","person&#x2019;s face so there could potentially be thousands or millions of\n","classes. However, when a user opts out of the system, their face\n","information must be removed without using a sample of their face.</p>\n","<p>Similar to feature removal, class removal is more challenging than\n","item removal because retraining solutions can incur many unlearning\n","passes. Even though each pass might only come at a small computational\n","cost due to data partitioning, the expense mounts up. However,\n","partitioning data by class itself does not help the model&#x2019;s training in\n","the first place, as learning the differences between classes is the core\n","of many learning algorithms&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-tanha2020boosting\">(Tanha et al. 2020)</a>. Although some\n","of the above techniques for feature removal can be applied to class\n","removal&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-warnecke2021machine\">(Warnecke et al. 2021)</a>, it is\n","not always the case as class information might be implicit in many\n","scenarios.</p>\n","<p>Tarun et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-tarun2021fast\">(Tarun\n","et al. 2021)</a> proposed an unlearning method for class removal\n","based on data augmentation. The basic concept is to introduce noise into\n","the model such that the classification error is maximized for the target\n","class(es). The model is updated by training on this noise without the\n","need to access any samples of the target class(es). Since such impair\n","step may disturb the model weights and degrade the classification\n","performance for the remaining classes, a repair step is needed to train\n","the model for one or a few more epochs on the remaining data. Their\n","experiments show that the method can be efficient for large-scale\n","multi-class problems (100 classes). Further, the method worked\n","especially well with face recognition tasks because the deep neural\n","networks were originally trained on triplet loss and negative samples so\n","the difference between the classes was quite significant&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-masi2018deep\">(Masi et al.\n","2018)</a>.</p>\n","<p>Baumhauer et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-baumhauer2020machine\">(Baumhauer, Sch&#xF6;ttle, and Zeppelzauer\n","2020)</a> proposed an unlearning method for class removal based on a\n","linear filtration operator that proportionally shifts the classification\n","of the samples of the class to be forgotten to other classes. However,\n","the approach is only applicable to class removal due to the\n","characteristics of this operator.</p>\n","<p><strong>Task Removal.</strong> Today, machine learning models are not\n","only trained for a single task but also for multiple tasks. This\n","paradigm, aka continual learning or lifelong learning&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-parisi2019continual\">(Parisi et al.\n","2019)</a>, is motivated by the human brain, in which learning\n","multiple tasks can benefit each other due to their correlations. This\n","technique is also used overcome data sparsity or cold-start problems\n","where there is not enough data to train a single task effectively.</p>\n","<p>However, in these settings too, there can be a need to remove private\n","data related to a specific task.

However, Bourtoule et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al.\n","2021)</a> notes that the algorithm cannot learn from the training\n","data in such a case. Gupta et el.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-gupta2021adaptive\">(Gupta et al. 2021)</a> proposed a\n","differentially private unlearning mechanism for streaming data removal\n","requests. These requests are adaptive as well, meaning the data to be\n","removed depends on the current unlearned model. The idea, which is based\n","on differential privacy, can be roughly formulated as: <span\n","class=\"math display\">Pr&#x2006;(<em>U</em>(<em>D</em>,<em>s</em>,<em>A</em>(<em>D</em>))&#x2208;&#x1D4AF;)&#x2004;&#x2264;&#x2004;<em>e</em><sup><em>&#x3F5;</em></sup><em>P</em><em>r</em>(<em>A</em>(<em>D</em>\\<em>s</em>)&#x2208;&#x1D4AF;)&#x2005;+&#x2005;<em>&#x3B2;</em></span>\n","for all adaptive removal sequences <span\n","class=\"math inline\"><em>s</em>&#x2004;=&#x2004;(<em>z</em><sub>1</sub>,&#x2026;,<em>z</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>)</span>.\n","One weakness of this condition is that it only guarantees the upper\n","bound of the unlearning scheme compared to full retraining. However, its\n","strength is that it supports a user&#x2019;s belief that the system has engaged\n","in full retraining. Finally, an unlearning process is developed by a\n","notion of differentially private publishing functions and a theoretical\n","reduction from adaptive to non-adaptive sequences. Differentially\n","private publishing functions guarantee that the model before and after\n","an unlearning request do not differ too much.</p>\n","<p><strong>Certified Removal Mechanisms.</strong> Unlearning algorithms\n","falling into this category are the ones following the original\n","approximate definition of machine unlearning&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-GuoGHM20 golatkar2020eternal\">(C. Guo et al. 2020; Golatkar,\n","Achille, and Soatto 2020a)</a>. While Guo et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-GuoGHM20\">(C.

The core idea is based on\n","the notion of perturbation (noise) to mask the small residue incurred by\n","the gradient-based update (e.g., a one-step Newton update&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-koh2017understanding\">(Koh et al.\n","2017)</a>). The idea is applicable to other cases, although no\n","theoretical guarantees are provided&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al. 2021)</a>.</p>\n","<p>More precisely, certified removal mechanisms mainly accommodate those\n","linear models that minimize a standardized empirical risk, which is the\n","total value of a convex loss function that measures the distance of the\n","actual value from the expected one&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-marchant2022hard\">(Marchant, Rubinstein, and Alfeld\n","2022)</a>. However, one has to rely on a customized learning\n","algorithm that optimizes a perturbed version of the regularized\n","empirical risk, where the added noise is drawn from a standard normal\n","distribution. This normalized noise allows conventional convex\n","optimization techniques to solve the learning problem with perturbation.\n","As a result, the unlearning request can be done by computing the model\n","perturbation towards the regularized empirical risk on the remaining\n","data. The final trick is that this perturbation can be approximated by\n","the influence function&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-koh2017understanding\">(Koh et al. 2017)</a>, which is\n","computed by inverting the Hessian on training data and the gradient of\n","the data to be forgotten&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-marchant2022hard\">(Marchant, Rubinstein, and Alfeld\n","2022)</a>. However, the error of model parameters in such a\n","computation can be so large that the added noise cannot mask it.\n","Therefore, if the provided theoretical upper bound exceeds a certain\n","threshold, the unlearning algorithm resorts to retraining from\n","scratch&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-marchant2022hard\">(Marchant,\n","Rubinstein, and Alfeld 2022)</a>.</p>\n","<p>Following this idea, Neel et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-neel2021descent\">(Neel, Roth, and Sharifi-Malvajerdi\n","2021)</a> provided further extensions, namely regularized perturbed\n","gradient descent and distributed perturbed gradient descent, to support\n","weak convex losses and provide theoretical guarantees on\n","indistinguishability, accuracy, and unlearning times.</p>\n","<p>Ullah et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-ullah2021machine\">(Ullah et al. 2021)</a> continued\n","studying machine unlearning in the context of SGD and streaming removal\n","requests.

Cao and Yang\n","2015)</a>. In this form, a data sample can be forgotten efficiently\n","by recomputing the statistics over the remaining data&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al.\n","2021)</a>. More precisely, statistical query learning assumes that\n","most of the learning algorithms can be represented as a sum of some\n","efficiently computable transformations, called statistical queries&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-kearns1998efficient\">(Kearns 1998)</a>.\n","These statistical queries are basically requests to an oracle (e.g., a\n","ground truth) to estimate a statistical function over all training data.\n","Cao et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards\">(Y. Cao\n","and Yang 2015)</a> showed that this formulation can generalize many\n","algorithms for machine learning, such as the Chi-square test, naive\n","Bayes, and linear regression. For example, in naive Bayes, these\n","statistical queries are indicator functions that return 1 when the\n","output is a target label and zero otherwise&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards\">(Y. Cao and Yang 2015)</a>. In the\n","unlearning process, these queries are simply recomputed over the\n","remaining data. The approach is efficient as these statistical functions\n","are computationally efficient in the first place. Moreover, statistical\n","query learning also supports adaptive statistical queries, which are\n","computed based on the prior state of the learning models, including\n","k-means, SVM, and gradient descent. Although this time, the unlearning\n","update makes the model not convergent any more, only a few learning\n","iterations (adaptive statistical queries) are needed since the model\n","starts from an almost-converged state. Moreover, if the old results of\n","the summations are cached, say, via dynamic programming, then the\n","speedup might be even higher.</p>\n","<p>The limitation of this approach is that it does not scale with\n","complex models such as deep neural networks. Indeed, in complex models,\n","the number of statistical queries could become exponentially large&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al.\n","2021)</a>, making both the unlearning and relearning steps less\n","efficient.</p>\n","<p>In general, statistical query learning supports item removal and can\n","be partially applied to stream removal&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-gupta2021adaptive\">(Gupta et al. 2021)</a> as well,\n","although the streaming updates to the summations could be unbounded. It\n","supports exact unlearning, but only partially when the statistical\n","queries are non-adaptive. It also partially supports zero-shot\n","unlearning, because only the statistics over the data need to be\n","accessed, not the individual training data items.</p>\n","<p><strong>Decremental Learning.</strong> Decremental learning\n","algorithms were originally designed to remove redundant samples and\n","reduce the training load on the processor for support vector machines\n","(SVM)&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-chen2019novel cauwenberghs2000incremental tveit2003multicategory tveit2003incremental romero2007incremental duan2007decremental\">(Y.\n","Chen et al. 2019; Cauwenberghs et al. 2000; Tveit et al. 2003; Tveit,\n","Hetland, and Engum 2003; Romero, Barrio, and Belanche 2007; Duan et al.\n","2007)</a> and linear classification&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-karasuyama2009multiple karasuyama2010multiple tsai2014incremental\">(Karasuyama\n","and Takeuchi 2009, 2010; Tsai, Lin, and Lin 2014)</a>.

The idea of quantization is to ensure\n","that small changes in the data do not change the model. Quantization\n","helps to avoid unnecessary unlearning so that accuracy is not\n","catastrophically degraded. However, it is only applicable when there are\n","few model parameters compared to the size of the dataset. The idea\n","behind the data partitioning is to restrict the data&#x2019;s influence on the\n","model parameters to only a few specific data partitions. This process\n","helps to pinpoint the effects of unlearning to a few data features. But,\n","again, the approach is only effective with a small number of features\n","compared to the size of the dataset. Notably, data privacy and data\n","deletion are not completely correlative&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-ginart2019making\">(Ginart et al. 2019)</a>.

In this\n","approach&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-chundawat2022can\">(Chundawat\n","et al. 2022a)</a>, one trains two neural networks as teachers\n","(competent and incompetent) and one neural network as a student. The\n","competent teacher is trained on the complete dataset, while the\n","incompetent teacher is randomly initialised.

More detailed\n","descriptions are given below.</p>\n","\n","<p><strong>Accuracy.</strong> In machine unlearning, a model&#x2019;s accuracy\n","needs to be compared on three different datasets: (1) The set to be\n","forgotten. Since the expected behaviour of an unlearned model after\n","unlearning should mirror that of a retrained model, the accuracy on the\n","remaining data should be similar to the retrained model. (2) The\n","retained set. The retained set&#x2019;s accuracy should be close to that of the\n","original model. (3) The test set. The unlearned model should still\n","perform well on a separate test dataset compared to the retrained\n","model.</p>\n","<p><strong>Completeness.</strong> The influence of the to-be-removed\n","samples on the unlearned model must be completely eliminated.\n","Completeness, hence, measures the degree to which an unlearned model is\n","compatible with a retrained model&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-cao2015towards\">(Y. Cao and Yang 2015)</a>. If the\n","unlearned model gives similar predictions to a retrained model for all\n","samples, the operation of feeding samples or observing the model&#x2019;s\n","information is impractical to achieve the forgotten data and its\n","lineage. The final metric is often calculated as the overlap of output\n","space (e.g., the Jaccard distance) between the unlearned model and the\n","retraining. However, computing this metric is often exhaustive.</p>\n","<p><strong>Unlearning time and Retraining time.</strong> Timeliness\n","quantifies the time saved when using unlearning instead of retraining\n","for model update. The quicker the system restores privacy, security, and\n","usefulness, the more timely the unlearning process. In particular,\n","retraining uses the whole training set to execute the learning\n","algorithm, whereas unlearning executes the learning algorithm on a\n","limited amount of summations; hence, the speed of unlearning is quicker\n","due to the reduced size of the training data.</p>\n","<p><strong>Relearn time.</strong> Relearning time is an excellent proxy\n","for measuring the amount of unlearned data information left in the\n","model. If a model recovers its performance on unlearned data with just a\n","few steps of retraining, it is extremely probable that the model has\n","retained some knowledge of the unlearned data.</p>\n","<p><strong>The layer-wise distance.</strong> The layer-wise distance\n","between the original and unlearned models helps when trying to\n","understand the impact of the unlearning on each layer. The weight\n","difference should be comparable to a retrained model given that a\n","shorter distance indicates ineffective unlearning. Likewise, a much\n","longer distance may point to a Streisand effect and possible information\n","leaks.</p>\n","<p><strong>Activation Distance.</strong> The activation distance is the\n","separation between the final activation of the scrubbed weights and the\n","retrained model. A shorter activation distance indicates superior\n","unlearning.</p>\n","<p><strong>JS-Divergence.</strong> When paired with the activation\n","distance, the JS-Divergence between the predictions of the unlearned and\n","retrained model provides a more full picture of unlearning. Less\n","divergence results in better unlearning.

Unlearning Federated\n","Learning</h2>\n","<p>Recently, federated learning has become popular in the field of\n","machine learning&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-mcmahan2017communication\">(McMahan et al. 2017)</a>. One\n","typical federated learning scenario is building a machine learning model\n","from healthcare information. Due to privacy regulations, the medical\n","record data cannot leave the clients&#x2019; devices. Here, the clients could\n","be hospitals or personal computers and are assumed to have machine\n","learning environments. The server does not transmit the actual data to\n","the global model. Rather, there is a communication protocol between the\n","clients and servers that governs collaborative model training&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-wu2022federated\">(C. Wu et al.\n","2022)</a>. In the literature, the communication protocol Federated\n","Average (FedAvg)&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-mcmahan2017communication\">(McMahan et al. 2017)</a> is\n","typically used for model training. It consists of multiple rounds. Each\n","round, the current global model weights are transmitted to the clients.\n","Based on these weights, each client uses stochastic gradient descent to\n","adjust their local model. Then the local model&#x2019;s weights are forwarded\n","to the server. In the final phase of each loop, the server aggregates\n","the received weights by (weighted) averaging to prepare the global model\n","for the next round&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-halimi2022federated\">(Halimi et al. 2022)</a>.</p>\n","<p>Given such training protocols, machine unlearning cannot be extended\n","easily to the federated learning setting. This is because the global\n","weights are computed by aggregations rather than raw gradients. These\n","are especially mixed up when many clients participate&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-gao2022verifi\">(X. Gao et al. 2022)</a>.\n","Moreover, these clients might have some overlapping data, making it\n","difficult to quantify the impact of each training item on the model\n","weights&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2020learn\">(Yang Liu et\n","al. 2020)</a>. Using classic unlearning methods by gradient\n","manipulation may even lead to severe accuracy degradation or new privacy\n","threats&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2021federaser\">(G. Liu et\n","al. 2021)</a>.</p>\n","<p>Additionally, current studies on federated unlearning tend to assume\n","that the data to be removed belongs wholly to one client&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2021federaser wang2022federated wu2022federated liu2020learn\">(G.\n","Liu et al. 2021; J. Wang, Guo, et al. 2022; C. Wu et al. 2022; Yang Liu\n","et al. 2020)</a>. With this assumption, the historical contributions\n","of particular clients to the global model&#x2019;s training can be logged and\n","erased easily. However, erasing historical parameter updates might still\n","damage the global model, but there are many strategies for overcoming\n","this issue. For example, Liu et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2021federaser\">(G. Liu et al. 2021)</a> proposed\n","calibration training to separate the individual contributions of clients\n","as much as possible. This mechanism does not work well for deep neural\n","networks, but it does work well with shallow architectures such as a\n","2-layer CNN or a network with two fully-connected layers. In addition,\n","there is a trade-off between scalability and precision due to the cost\n","of storing historical information on the federated server. Wu et\n","al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-wu2022federated\">(C. Wu et al.\n","2022)</a> put forward a knowledge distillation strategy that uses a\n","prime global model to train the unlearned model on the remaining data.\n","However, as the clients&#x2019; data is not accessible by the server, some\n","unlabeled (synthetic) data that follows the distribution of the whole\n","dataset needs to be sampled and extra rounds of information exchange are\n","needed between the clients and server. As a result, the whole process is\n","costly and approximate. Also, it might be further offset when the data\n","is non-IID&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2022right\">(Yi Liu et\n","al. 2022)</a>. On another spectrum, Liu et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2022right\">(Yi Liu et al. 2022)</a> proposed a smart\n","retraining method for federated unlearning without communication\n","protocols.

However, this method is only applicable to\n","small models (<span class=\"math inline\">&#x2264;</span> 10K parameters). Plus,\n","it involves storing old model snapshots (including historical gradients\n","and parameters), which poses some privacy threats.</p>\n","\n","<h2 id=\"unlearning-in-graph-embedding\">6.3. Unlearning in Graph\n","Embedding</h2>\n","<p>So far the data in machine unlearning settings is assumed to be\n","independent. However, there are many cases where the data samples are\n","relational, such as is the case with graph data. Graph representation\n","learning is a well-established research direction in machine learning,\n","specifically in deep learning&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-hamilton2020graph chen2020graph\">(Hamilton 2020; F. Chen et\n","al. 2020)</a>. However, applying machine unlearning to graph\n","representation learning is arguably more challenging. First, the data is\n","correlated, and it is non-trivial to partition the data, even uniformly.\n","Second, the unlearning requests can happen upon a node or an edge.\n","Third, the graph data itself might be non-uniform due to unbalanced\n","connected components in the graph. Therefore, existing graph partition\n","methods might lead to unbalanced data partitions, making the retraining\n","process non-uniform.</p>\n","<p>To mitigate these problems, Chen et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-chen2021graph\">(M. Chen et al. 2021a)</a> proposed a new\n","graph partitioning strategies especially for machine unlearning. The\n","general idea is based on the notion of assignment preference that\n","represents the benefit of a node assigned to a shard (i.e., a data\n","partition). Such node-shard pairs are further fine-tuned with neighbor\n","counts, which track down the number of neighbors of a node belonging to\n","the same target shard. The authors also proposed an aggregation method\n","to combine different partition strategies. Further, the retraining\n","process is based on message passing in graph neural networks, which\n","facilitates fast retraining.</p>\n","<p>Unlearning without retraining is also possible for graph embedding.\n","However, several challenges need to be overcome. The interdependency of\n","graph data, especially across different subgraphs, is non-trivial for\n","model training. A removal of node and edge could not only cause an\n","impact on its neighbor but also on multi-hops. Cong et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-congprivacy conggrapheditor\">(Cong and\n","Mahdavi 2022b, 2022a)</a> proposed a one-shot unlearning solution\n","that only requires access to the data to be forgotten. The idea is\n","inspired by the architecture of a linear graph neural network (GNN), in\n","which non-linearities in a typical GNN are replaced by a single weight\n","matrix between consecutive convolutional layers. Despite its linear span\n","over all input node features, such linear-GNNs have shown competent\n","performance, e.g.&#xA0;SGC&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-wu2019simplifying\">(F.

Clearly, this solution is impractical not only\n","due to computational cost but also because there is no guarantee that\n","the model will converge and nor is there a guarantee that the forgetting\n","will not happen again&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-parisi2019continual\">(Parisi et al. 2019)</a>. Du et\n","al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-du2019lifelong\">(Du, Chen, et al.\n","2019)</a> suggested a solution based on unlearning to prevent\n","catastrophic forgetting. The core idea is to unlearn harmful samples\n","(e.g., false negatives/positives) and then update the model so that its\n","performance before the forgetting effect is maintained.</p>\n","<p>Unlearning has also been used to handle exploding losses in machine\n","learning. Here, the term loss involves the computation of <span\n","class=\"math inline\">&#x2005;&#x2212;&#x2005;log&#x2006;<em>P</em><em>r</em>(<em>x</em>)</span>, and,\n","when <span class=\"math inline\"><em>P</em><em>r</em>(<em>x</em>)</span>\n","is approximately zero, the loss may be arbitrarily significant. The\n","problem is more severe in anomaly detection where normal samples can\n","have very small <span\n","class=\"math inline\"><em>P</em><em>r</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> (abnormal\n","samples have very large <span\n","class=\"math inline\"><em>P</em><em>r</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> and their\n","sum of probabilities is one). Du et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-du2019lifelong\">(Du, Chen, et al. 2019)</a> hence\n","proposed an unlearning method to mitigate this problem with an\n","unlearning loss that regularizes those extreme cases.</p>\n","<p>Unlearning has been studied for other lifelong settings as well&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-parne2021machine\">(Parne et al.\n","2021)</a>. These setting use incremental models, such as decision\n","tree and naive Bayes, which allows the model to unlearn data samples\n","on-the-fly. Liu et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2022continual\">(B. Liu, Liu, et al. 2022)</a>\n","considered requests on unlearning specific tasks for lifelong models. In\n","particular, there are three types of requests in lifelong learning: (i)\n","to learn a task permanently, (ii) to learn a task temporarily and forget\n","it later upon a privacy request, and (iii) to forget a task. Different\n","from traditional machine unlearning, unlearning in lifelong learning\n","needs to maintain knowledge transfer between tasks but also preserve all\n","knowledge for the remaining tasks. Moreover, the setting is more\n","challenging as it depends on the order of tasks as the tasks are learnt\n","online during the model lifetime. Additionally, the model cannot keep\n","all previous data (zero-glance unlearning), making the unlearning\n","process more challenging. Liu et al.&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-liu2022continual\">(B. Liu, Liu, et al. 2022)</a> proposed\n","a solution inspired by SISA, the data partitioning mechanism for smart\n","retraining&#xA0;<a href=\"#ref-bourtoule2021machine\">(Bourtoule et al. 2021)</a>. It\n","creates an isolated temporary model for each task and merges the\n","isolated models into the main model.</p>\n","\n","\n","<h1 id=\"sec:discussion\">7.
